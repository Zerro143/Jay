S-PO/TI/17H,S-PO/TI/17H-532,"Evolution Line (Titanium)","EV - Evolution","ECE Type Approval","The Evolution Line (Titanium) exhaust system for the Porsche Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid (536) has a stunning soundtrack that makes the most of the car’s V8 turbocharged engine, providing an acoustic performance wherever the car might travel. The deep, strong growl offers a true feeling of the immense torque the engine has to offer, and as the revs rise high frequency overtones add to the enjoyment. This has been achieved with intelligent design of the X-crossing element in the link pipes, allowing the exhaust gases to mix from both sides of the engine and influence the overall sound, all without any compromise to aural comfort. Constructed from high-grade titanium and finished with a choice of eye-catching double round tailpipes in either handmade carbon fibre or sandblasted and coated titanium, this system looks as good as it sounds. The performance has been measured by the Akrapovič technicians, showing an increase in power of +11.5 kW at 3,150 rpm and an enhanced torque return of +35.0. Nm at 3,100 rpm. Full ECE compliance and plug-and-play installation, requiring no need to remap the ECU, make the Evolution Line (Titanium) exhaust system for Porsche Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid (536) an impressive product.For increased aural enjoyment, an optional Akrapovič Sound Kit can be added to offer the user greater flexibility and control over the system’s sound.

The Akrapovič sound engineers have produced a rich, harmonic, high-frequency tone from the system in the upper rev range, which perfectly combines with the deep sound in the lower range to provide an aural experience in the cabin with no drone and a sound that lingers long after the throttle is released.Constructed from lightweight high-grade titanium, with parts made in the in-house foundry to create a perfect fit within the limited space available, the three mufflers – two side and one central – are configured in a unique way, perfectly engineered by the Akrapovič technicians. There is a choice between two different sets of round titanium tailpipes, sandblasted and coated, and available in a natural titanium finish or black.

Produced from lightweight titanium, the system uses complex parts meticulously crafted using the in-house titanium foundry to offer perfect acoustics. An instant deepness prevails from the moment the engine is started and as the revs rise, and so does the sensory involvement. At low rpms the exhaust emits a deep, iconic flat-six rumble, moving through a powerful mid-range, which then develops into a rich, strong, and high-frequency acoustic sensation at high revs, perfectly tuned to upshifts, providing a thrilling experience as the higher gears are selected and exhilarating, race-inspired burbles through the downshifts. This sound pattern is achieved with a carefully calculated H-link between the main pipes, which is precisely welded at a selected position. The system has been developed for use on closed-course competition circuits, but there is no compromise on comfort because the tuning of the system eliminates any drone or unwanted flow noise. Power and torque increases have been recorded at +16.6 kW (22.5 hp) and +46.8 Nm at 3,400 rpm when tested in back-to-back runs on the Akrapovič dyno against a Porsche 911 Turbo (992) using the Porsche stock sports exhaust system, with the torque curve offering a perfect response from low down engine speed.

Different sound modes offer a pleasant experience in comfort mode – without any intrusive drone – and, when the driving gets more dynamic and enthusiastic, the exhaust produces a vibrant and deep roar from the six-cylinder engine, which the Supra is well known for, and adds an exciting and exhilarating sensation as the revs rise.An optional Akrapovič Sound Kit is available to control the various sound settings, and optional tuning opportunities exist through the addition of the stainless-steel Evolution Link Pipe set. As with the Sound Kit, fitting the Link Pipe will negate the ECE type approval.Fitment and ECE type-approval are valid for engine type B58B30C. ECE type approval is only valid for cars equipped with otto/gasoline particulate filter. For installing the slip-on system, the stock exhaust system has to be cut. Please read the instructions carefully before the start of the installation.","New Avgassystem","Super Sport",Car,Toyota,"Supra (A90) - OPF/GPF",2019,2020,40534,
S-TY/T/2,S-TY/T/2-572,"Slip-On Race Line (Titanium)","SO - Slip-On",,"This exhaust is produced using race-proven, high-grade titanium for the entire system and features megaphone-shaped tailpipes. A collector centred between the rear resonators has been cast in the in-house foundry; this collector optimizes and balances the gas flow to produce an acoustically tuned sound with no drone. Three resonators – two at the back of the collector and one in the middle pipe – further tune the sound experience to create a sporty racing tone, fully enhancing the engine’s characteristics with a deep and enthusiastic sound, to give the occupants a feeling of exhilaration that is never interrupted by excess noise. The engineers have placed a special emphasis on the acoustics in the middle and high rev range, with a high-frequency tone at higher rpms and more sound at idle and revving. This sound is managed by two megaphone-shaped titanium tailpipes that are welded to the exhaust and specially coated to resist any colour changes at high temperatures. The shape of the tailpipes influences the sound. They are bigger than stock, measuring in at 110 mm, and have a similar profile to the Akrapovič exhaust for the Toyota GR Supra. Developed to decrease back pressure, the system weighs in at 7,8 kg, which is 37 % lighter than stock and yields power gains of 9.5 kW (12.9 hp) at 6,950 rpm and torque increases of 13.0 Nm at 6,950 rpm when tested on the Akrapovič dyno against a Toyota GR Yaris with a standard stock exhaust. This exhaust is designed for use on racetracks and closed courses only. It is necessary to cut the stock exhaust system when installing this product, but no ECU remapping is needed for this configuration.An optional Evolution link pipe is available for customers looking to extend the exhaust tuning possibilities for even better performance of the Akrapovič Slip-On Race Line (Titanium) system.THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT MEET EMISSION COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR STREET OR HIGHWAY USE.","New Avgassystem","Hot Hatch",Car,Toyota,"GR Yaris",2021,2021,34080,
